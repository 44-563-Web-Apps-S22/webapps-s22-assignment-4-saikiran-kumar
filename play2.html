SCENE II.--<div class="speech"><p class="CLEANTE">CLÉANTE,</p><p class="ELISE">ÉLISE</p></div>

<h5 class="name">CLE.</h5>
<p> I am very glad to find you alone, sister. I longed to speak to
you and to tell you a secret.</p>

<h5 class="name">ELI.</h5>
<p> I am quite ready to hear you, brother. What is it you have to
tell me?</p>

<h5 class="name">CLE.</h5>
<p> Many things, sister, summed up in one word--love.</p>

<h5 class="name">ELI.</h5>
<p> You love?</p>

<h5 class="name">CLE.</h5>
<p> Yes, I love. But, before I say more, let me tell you that I know
I depend on my father, and that the name of son subjects me to his
will; that it would be wrong to engage ourselves without the consent
of the authors of our being; that heaven has made them the masters of
our affections, and that it is our duty not to dispose of ourselves
but in accordance to their wish; that their judgment is not biassed by
their being in love themselves; that they are, therefore, much more
likely not to be deceived by appearances, and to judge better what is
good for us; that we ought to trust their experience rather than the
passion which blinds us; and that the rashness of youth often carries
us to the very brink of dangerous abysses. I know all this, my sister,
and I tell it you to spare you the trouble of saying it to me, for my
love will not let me listen to anything, and I pray you to spare me
your remonstrances.</p>

<h5 class="name">ELI.</h5>
<p> Have you engaged yourself, brother, to her you love?</p>

<h5 class="name">CLE.</h5>
<p>No, but I have determined to do so; and I beseech you once more
not to bring forward any reason to dissuade me from it.</p>
