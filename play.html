        <h4>The Miser (L'Avare)</h4>
        <h5>
            This play was acted for the first time on September 9, 1668. In it,
Molière has borrowed from Plautus, and has imitated several other
authors, but he far surpasses them in the treatment of his subject.
The picture of the miser, in whom love of money takes the place of all
natural affections, who not only withdraws from family intercourse,
but considers his children as natural enemies, is finely drawn, and
renders Molière's Miser altogether more dramatic and moral than those
of his predecessors.<br><br>

Molière acted the part of
HARpagon.<br><br>

SCENE IV.-<p class="speech">HARPAGON (_alone_.)</p><br><br>

This rascally VALet is a constant vexation to me; and I hate the very
sight of the good-for-nothing cripple. Really, it is no small anxiety
to keep by one a large sum of money; and happy is the man who has all
his cash well invested, and who needs not keep by him more than he
wants for his daily expenses. I am not a little puzzled to find in the
whole of this house a safe hiding-place. Don't speak to me of your
strong boxes, I will never trust to them. Why, they are just the very
things thieves set upon!<br><br>


SCENE V.<p class="speech">-HARPAGON, ÉLISE _and_ CLÉANTE _are seen talking together at
the back of the stage._</p><br>


<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. (_thinking himself alone_.) Meanwhile, I
<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>dly know whether I
did right to bury in my garden the ten thousand crowns which were paid
to me yesterday. Ten thousand crowns in gold is a sum sufficiently ...
<p class="direction">(_Aside, on perceiving_ ÉLISE _and_ CLÉANTE _whispering together_)</p>
Good heavens! I have betrayed myself; my warmth has carried me away. I
bELIeve I spoke aloud while reasoning with myself.<p class="direction"> (_To_ CLÉANTE _and_
ÉLISE)</p> What do you want?<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. Nothing, father.<br>



<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. We were afraid of coming near you, for fear of intruding.<br>



<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. Dear me, father, you have no reason to complain; and everyone
knows that you are well enough off.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. How? I am well enough off! Those who say it are liars. Nothing
can be more false; and they are scoundrels who spread such reports.<br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. Don't be angry.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. And you?<br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. I have heard her spoken of.<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. Certainly.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. And that a husband might live very happily with her?<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. I have not the least doubt about it.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. There is one little difficulty; I am afraid she has not the
fortune we might reasonably expect.<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. Oh, my father, riches are of little importance when one is sure
of marrying a virtuous woman.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. I beg your pardon. Only there is this to be said: that if we do
not find as much money as we could wish, we may make it up in
something else.<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. That follows as a matter of course.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Well, I must say that I am very much pleased to find that you
entirely agree with me, for her modest manner and her gentleness have
won my heart; and I have made up my mind to marry her, provided I find
she has some dowry.<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. Eh!<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. What now?<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. You are resolved, you say...?<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. To marry Marianne.<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. Who? you? you?<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Yes, I, I, I. What does all this mean?<br>

<h5 class="name">CLE</h5>. I feel a sudden dizziness, and I must withdraw for a little
while.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. It will be nothing. Go quickly into the kitchen and drink a large
glass of cold water, it will soon set you all right again.<br><br>


SCENE VI.<p class="speech">-HARPAGON, ÉLISE.</p><br><br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. There goes one of your effeminate fops, with no more stamina than
a chicken. That is what I have resolved for myself, my daughter. As to
your brother, I have thought for him of a certain widow, of whom I
heard this morning; and you I shall give to Mr. Anselme.<br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. To Mr. Anselme?<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Yes, a staid and prudent man, who is not above fifty, and of
whose riches everybody speaks.<br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>.<p class="direction"> (_curtseying_)</p>. I have no wish to marry, father, if you
please.<br>



<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. This evening.<br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. <p class="direction">(_curtseying again_)</p>. It cannot be done, father.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>.<p class="direction">(_imitating_ ÉLISE)</p>. It will be done, daughter.<br>


<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. Willingly.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. You will abide by what he says?<br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. Yes, whatever he thinks right, I will do.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Agreed.<br><br>


SCENE VII.--<p calss="speech">VALÈRE,HARPAGON, ÉLISE.</p><br><br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. VALère, we have chosen you to decide who is in the right, my
daughter or I.<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. It is certainly you, Sir.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. But have you any idea of what we are talking about?<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. No; but you could not be in the wrong; you are reason itself.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. I want to give her to-night, for a husband, a man as rich as he
is good; and the hussy tells me to my face that she scorns to take
him. What do you say to that?<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. What I say to it?<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Yes?<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. Eh! eh!<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. What?<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. I say that I am, upon the whole, of your opinion, and that you
cannot but be right; yet, perhaps, she is not altogether wrong;
and ...<br>


<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. Without dowry?<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Yes.<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. Ah! I have nothing more to say. A more convincing reason could
not be found; and she must yield to that.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. It is a considerable saving to me.<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. Undoubtedly; this admits of no contradiction. It is true that
your daughter might represent to you that marriage is a more serious
affair than people are apt to bELIeve; that the happiness or misery of
a whole life depends on it, and that an engagement which is to last
till death ought not to be entered into without great consideration.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Without dowry!<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. That must of course decide everything. There are certainly people
who might tell you that on such occasions the wishes of a daughter are
no doubt to be considered, and that this great disparity of age, of
disposition, and of feELIngs might be the cause of many an unpleasant
thing in a married life.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Without dowry!<br>



<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Without dowry!<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. That is true; nothing more can be said.  Without dowry. How can
anyone resist such arguments?<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>.<p class="direction"> (_aside, looking towards the garden_)</p>. Ah! I fancy I hear a dog
barking. Is anyone after my money. (_To_ VALÈRE) Stop here, I'll come
back directly.
<br><br>

SCENE VIII.--<p class="speech">ÉLISE, VALÈRE.</p><br><br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. Surely, VALère, you are not in earnest when you speak to him in
that manner?<br>



<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. But this marriage, VALère?<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. We will find some pretext for breaking it off.<br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. But what pretext can we find if it is to be concluded to-night?<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. You must ask to have it delayed, and must feign some illness or
other.<br>

<h5 class="name">ELI</h5>. But he will soon discover the truth if they call in the doctor.<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. Not a bit of it. Do you imagine that a doctor understands what he
is about? Nonsense! Don't be afraid. BELIeve me, you may complain of
any disease you please, the doctor will be at no loss to explain to
you from what it proceeds.<br><br>


SCENE IX-<p class="speech">HARPAGON, ÉLISE, VALÈRE.</p><br><br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>.<p class="direction"> (_alone, at the farther end of the stage_)</p>. It is nothing,
thank heaven!<br>


<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Good; that was beautifully said!<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. I beg your pardon, Sir, if I carry it a little too far, and take
upon myself to speak to her as I do.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Why, I am dELIghted, and I wish you to have her entirely under
your control. (_To_ ÉLISE) Yes, you may run away as much as you like.
I give him all the authority over you that heaven has given me, and I
will have you do all that he tells you.<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. After that, resist all my expostulations, if you can.<br><br>


SCENE X.<p class="speech">-HARPAGON, VALÈRE.</p><br><br>


<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. I will follow her, Sir, if you will allow me, and will continue
the lecture I was giving her.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Yes, do so; you will oblige me greatly.<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. She ought to be kept in with a tight hand.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Quite true, you must....<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>. Do not be afraid; I bELIeve I shall end by convincing her.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Do so, do so. I am going to take a short stroll in the town, and
I will come back again presently.<br>

<h5 class="name">VAL</h5>.<p class="direction"> (_going towards the door through which_ ÉLISE _left, and speaking
as if it were to her_)</p>. Yes, money is more precious than anything else
in the world, and you should thank heaven that you have so worthy a
man for a father. He knows what life is. When a man offers to marry a
girl without a dowry, we ought to look no farther. Everything is
comprised in that, and "without dowry" compensates for want of beauty,
youth, birth, honour, wisdom, and probity.<br>

<h5 class="name">HAR</h5>. Ah! the honest fellow! he speaks like an oraCLE. Happy is he who
can secure such a servant!<br>
